  <h1>Privacy Policy for Pete Desk Assistant</h1>
  <p>Last updated: May 2025</p>

  <p>Pete Desk Assistant is a voice-based personal assistant that runs entirely on your local device (such as a Raspberry Pi).</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The assistant does not collect or store any personal data. All voice recognition, reminders, and command processing happens locally on your device.</p>

  <p>When you authorize access to your Google Calendar, your calendar data is used temporarily to read upcoming events, and is never stored or shared.</p>

  <h2>Data Usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Calendar data is used only to respond to your voice query (e.g., “what’s on my calendar?”).</li>
    <li>No data is sent to any external server, third-party, or cloud service other than Google APIs required to access your calendar.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This app uses the Google Calendar API. Please refer to Google's <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns, contact us at: <strong>your_email@example.com</strong></p>
